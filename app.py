            You are required to generate a single, complete, and runnable Python script that fully solves the following task. 

            Question/Task:
            {question_content}

            Available Data:
            {data_description}

            STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
            1. Your output must be a single complete Python script with fully implemented, runnable code for all tasks. No notes, explanations, markdown, placeholders, or comments.
            2. Handle missing data gracefully.
            3. Generate all required visualizations as base64 PNG images under 100kB.
            4. Return results as a JSON object with EXACTLY the keys and format requested in the Question/Task.
            5. CRITICAL: Each question or required key in the JSON output MUST be implemented in its own logical block with its own try-except. 
            - Do NOT wrap multiple questions together under one try/except.
            - Each answer/plot/analysis step should be protected by a small, localized try-except block.
            6. Use mock/sample data if external APIs are not available.
            7. Do NOT include any triple backticks (```) or markdown formatting.
            8. The code must be ready to execute AS-IS without any modifications.
            9. Always return ONLY valid Python code — no natural language text at all outside of comments inside the code.
            10. CRITICAL: Match the exact response format and JSON keys requested in the Question/Task.
            11. IMPORTANT: Load data files directly from the current working directory (e.g., open('user-posts.json'), pd.read_csv('network-connections.csv')) without path prefixes.
            12. MANDATORY: At the end of your script, print the final results as JSON to standard output. Always include:
                print(json.dumps(results, indent=2))
            13. If a public API exists for the requested data, use it. Otherwise:
            * 1) Fetch the webpage HTML.
            * 2) Convert the HTML to Markdown with html2text (include the complete content).
            * 3) Send the complete Markdown to OpenAI to obtain structured JSON.
            * 4) When calling OpenAI:

            * Use client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4.1", ...).
            * You must use gpt-4.1 model only.
            * The messages must instruct the model to return only a single compact/minified JSON object with no spaces or line breaks, no markdown, no backticks, and no explanations; use exactly and only the required keys; use null for missing values; if extraction fails, return {{"error":"reason"}}; do not include any text before or after the JSON.
            * 5) When scraping:

            * Follow robots.txt and site TOS, use a polite User-Agent, add small randomized delays, avoid heavy/abusive requests, and never bypass CAPTCHAs, paywalls, or access controls.

            

            14. Try-Expect:
            - Each major operation that corresponds to a question or output key must have its own try-except.
            - If one visualization or analysis fails, continue with the next.
            - Add appropriate error messages to the results dictionary when operations fail.
            - Example pattern:
            results = {{}}
            # Q1
            
            try:
                results['total_posts_analyzed'] = len(posts)
            except Exception as e:
                results['total_posts_analyzed_error'] = f"{{type(e).__name__}}, {{e}}"

            except Exception as e:
                results['high_risk_users_error'] = f"{{type(e).__name__}}, {{e}}"

            FINAL INSTRUCTION:
            Do not add any notes, disclaimers, or partial/incomplete indicators. 
            The output must be a single, complete, runnable Python script only, with one try/except per logical requirement.
